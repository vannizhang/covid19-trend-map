                        The y-axis of chart lines are consistent within each of

                        counties are constrained by a scaled y-axis.
                        Specifically, outliers are defined for NEW CASES PER
                        CAPITA as counties with greater than 200 cases per
                        100,000 population; DEATHS PER CAPITA outliers are
                        defined as counties with numbers of weekly deaths that
                        are two standard deviations (currently a rate of{' '}
                        {ymax4deaths} per 10 million population) higher than the
                        national average; CUMULATIVE CASES outliers are defined
                        as counties with counts that are two standard deviations
                        above (currently {ymax4confirmed}) the national mean.
